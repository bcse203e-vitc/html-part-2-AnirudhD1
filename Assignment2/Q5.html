                    <p>Physicists at MIT have successfully measured the quantum geometry of electrons in solids, marking a pivotal moment in quantum research. This was achieved using an advanced adaptation of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), enabling direct observation of quantum properties that were previously theoretical. The study, featured in Nature Physics, focused on a material known as kagome metal, opening doors for deeper understanding and practical manipulation of quantum materials. The research highlights collaboration between experimentalists and theorists, with significant contributions made during the pandemic.e</p>

                    <img src="img/headline2.jpeg" alt="Image for Headline 2" width="300">
                    <p>Eighteen-year-old D. Gukesh has made history by becoming the 18th world chess champion, which will make him the youngest to do so and emulating the doyen of Indian chess, Viswanathan Anand, the only other Indian to achieve the honour. Gukesh managed his feat after a blunder made by the reigning world champion, Ding Liren of China, on the 55th move, Rf2, in the 14th and final classical game of the match. </p>
                    <h3>Key Points</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li> D. Gukesh, at 18, became the youngest ever world chess champion, defeating Ding Liren after a blunder in the 14th game.</li>
                        <li>His victory highlights the rise of young Indian talent, including Arjun Erigaisi and R. Praggnanandhaa.</li>
                        <li>Gukesh's mental toughness and deep calculation skills were key to his success and his win is a major boost for chess in India./li>

                    <p>Anti-Pollution Measures (GRAP-4) Revoked In Delhi As Air Quality Improves</p>
                    <h3>Key Points</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>GRAP-4 Revoked: Stage-4 curbs under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) have been lifted due to improvement in Delhi's air quality</li>
                        <li>AQI Status: The Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 364 (very poor) at 5 PM, which is 36 points below the threshold for Stage-4 curbs.</li>
                        <li>Ongoing Restrictions: Measures under Stages 1, 2, and 3 remain in place to prevent further worsening of air quality.</li>
